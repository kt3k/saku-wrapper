# saku-wrapper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kt3k/saku-wrapper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kt3k/saku-wrapper)

saku-wrapper is the wrapper script of [saku](https://github.com/kt3k/saku). It is similar to gradle wrapper for gradle. The users don't need to install saku for themselves. saku-wrapper installs it on the fly and runs it.
